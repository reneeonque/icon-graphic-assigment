			<h10>In 2019, the C4E goal for the average 4th-8th grade class room in School District 30 was lowered to 22.9 students. Yet, the class size average was 26.3 students, significantly higher than the goal. According to Class Size Matters, "4th-8th [grade] class sizes...are now larger than the C4E goal in 2019 by 3.4 students per class."</h10>

		<div id="explanation">
			<p><b>It's apparent from the data above that the class sizes in District 30 are only getting larger, despite the C4E goal that was set over ten years ago. District 30 is already an overcrowded district that lacks space for students. If class sizes continue to grow, the circumstances will only get worse, especially during a pandemic.</b></p>

			<p>Parents in District 30 are forced to send their children to private schools, charter schools or schools outside of their district to avoid this issue. Debra McGowan, the co-founder of the "Sunnyside Woodside Middle School Project" described her efforts to get a new middle school in Sunnyside, "I even got signatures from people in District 24 saying please get your kids out of district because we're overcrowded." This problem extends to multiple school districts in Queens.</p>
